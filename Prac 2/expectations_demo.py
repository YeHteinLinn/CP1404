CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

'''Question 1: ValueError occures when nothing is typed or any type of input rather than int is typed
    Question 2: ZeroDivisionError occurs when the denominator is inputted as "0" '''
